DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS: CODE & CONCEPTS

This repository contains code samples that illustrate most major data-structure and algorithm (DSA) concepts.

Topics covered:
1. Arrays  
2. Recursion  
3. Divide and Conquer  
4. Backtracking  
5. Linked Lists  
6. Stacks  
7. Queues  
8. Binary Trees / Binary Search Trees  
9. Heaps  
10. Hashing  
11. Tries  
12. Graphs  
13. Greedy Algorithms  
14. Dynamic Programming  

This README documents the DSA sample code I wrote while studying these topics.
